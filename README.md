**ENOSIUM PROJECT**

This project is made by me for the ENOSIUM hacathon hosted by Cynaptics Club and GDSC IIT Indore under Central India's Largest fest FLUXUS.

The PS which I chose was to make an education platform to funfill various educational needs of students such as resources, summaries etc.

For the purpose of the project I have used Gemini pro of google along with various python libraries such as PyPDF2,textwrap,fpdp,etc.

The project has various features such as resource guide,pdf summarizer, question paper generator etc.

Demo for my project can be seen at
